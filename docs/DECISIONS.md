# Decisions

## 2026-09-19 — Use Vercel and Supabase for the public prototype

The public prototype deploys the Vite frontend and privileged Node functions to Vercel, while Supabase provides Postgres, anonymous Auth, Row Level Security, Realtime, and later Storage. This gives the demo persistent room URLs and multi-browser collaboration without operating a custom WebSocket server on a serverless platform.

## 2026-09-19 — Retain a local same-origin development server

Superseded for deployment by the Vercel/Supabase decision above. Express remains the local Vite/static-preview host; persistent room state belongs in Supabase, and collaboration uses Supabase Realtime.

## 2026-09-19 — Keep sponsor technologies behind adapters

Nebius, SLNG, fal.ai, Titan, and any confirmed HackBarna sponsor capability are server-side integrations behind typed adapters. The product contracts do not depend on one model/vendor, and no provider is represented as available before a live probe confirms it.

## 2026-09-19 — Server owns collaborative story state

The server is authoritative for membership, queue ordering, votes, story versions, accepted scenes, and budgets. Clients render snapshots/events and can show pending feedback, but cannot commit a scene independently.

## 2026-09-19 — Use Titan catalogue records as real cinema, not synthetic content

The Discover experience renders Titan-provided real films and series faithfully. Catalogue metadata and generated Movie Jam artifacts have separate schemas, identifiers, and labels so the product never presents an invented/generated work as a real title or rewrites existing films as jokes.

## 2026-09-19 — Treat media as declared creative references

Images, uploaded clips, and live camera are inputs to a shared creative turn, not opaque prompt attachments. Each has an owner, consent state, declared purpose, lifetime, and server-issued asset reference. Live media uses Vonage for room transport and fal.ai only for explicitly permitted creative transformation.

## 2026-09-19 — Start with one same-origin local development server

The first runnable baseline serves the Vite client through the Node/Express process at `127.0.0.1:4317`. This keeps browser-to-server contracts and provider boundaries easy to iterate on locally. It is a local development baseline, not the public deployment configuration.

## 2026-09-19 — Align deployment and collaboration foundation

Vercel serves the Vite SPA and `/api` Node functions. API paths are excluded from the SPA rewrite; health does not assert provider/database readiness. Supabase owns identity and persistent state. No extra database, WebSocket service or provider integration is introduced.

The primary agent commits and pushes completed verified slices directly to `main`, including documentation. The collaborator uses isolated PR branches and auto-merge after checks. Fetch before publication, stage owned files explicitly, and never force-push shared history.
