# Decisions

## 2026-09-19 — Start with a single-process real-time architecture

The first public build uses a React/Vite client and one TypeScript Node/Express server with `ws` WebSockets and in-memory rooms. This makes the live demo small, inspectable, and easy to run. Restarts reset rooms visibly; distributed persistence is deferred until it is required.

## 2026-09-19 — Keep sponsor technologies behind adapters

Nebius, SLNG, fal.ai, Titan, and any confirmed HackBarna sponsor capability are server-side integrations behind typed adapters. The product contracts do not depend on one model/vendor, and no provider is represented as available before a live probe confirms it.

## 2026-09-19 — Server owns collaborative story state

The server is authoritative for membership, queue ordering, votes, story versions, accepted scenes, and budgets. Clients render snapshots/events and can show pending feedback, but cannot commit a scene independently.

## 2026-09-19 — Use Titan catalogue records as real cinema, not synthetic content

The Discover experience renders Titan-provided real films and series faithfully. Catalogue metadata and generated Movie Jam artifacts have separate schemas, identifiers, and labels so the product never presents an invented/generated work as a real title or rewrites existing films as jokes.

## 2026-09-19 — Treat media as declared creative references

Images, uploaded clips, and live camera are inputs to a shared creative turn, not opaque prompt attachments. Each has an owner, consent state, declared purpose, lifetime, and server-issued asset reference. Live media uses Vonage for room transport and fal.ai only for explicitly permitted creative transformation.

## 2026-09-19 — Start with one same-origin local development server

The first runnable baseline serves the Vite client through the Node/Express process at `127.0.0.1:4317`. This keeps browser-to-server contracts, future WebSocket upgrades, and provider credentials on one trusted origin during early development. It is a local development baseline, not a public deployment configuration.
